## What are Smart Contracts?

Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediaryâ€™s involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met.

## Things you need to build and deploy your first Smart Contract

1. Motivation
2. You need to have your IDE (Integrated Development Environment). I would be using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) (Online Ethereum IDE).

---

## Step 1 - Solidity IDE - Remix

The fastest way to run a solidity smart contract is by using an online Solidity IDE like Remix (recommended).

The Remix IDE is a powerful, open source Solidity IDE that allows us to quickly write, compile, and deploy smart contracts directly from the web browser.

Visit [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to launch the Remix IDE on your browser.

## Step 2 - Creating a Solidity Source File

Next, locate the contracts folder under the "File Explorers" section and create a new `Gem_Mine.sol` file inside like this:

<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y6z01cweerkg7w0895ks.png">

## Step 3 - Writing the Smart Contract

In this step, we're going to write a `Gem_Mine` smart contract that will store location data for the Mines.

Copy and paste the code below inside of your `Gem_Mine` file:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

contract GemMine {
    function checkStatus() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Mine is Working With 100% Accuracy";
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Mine) mines;
    uint256 public counter = 0;

    struct Mine {
        uint256 id;
        string location;
    }

    function addMine(string memory location) public {
        counter += 1;
        mines[counter] = Mine(counter, location);
    }

    function getLocation(uint256 id) public view returns (uint256 mineID, string memory location) {
        return (mines[id].id, mines[id].location);
    }
}
```

---

## 1. Solidity Smart Contract License

Every developer is encouraged to add a machine readable license at the top of their Solidity Source file, as shown below:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```

The MIT license is similar to the license you'll find on GitHub. You can add the `UNLICENSED` value if you don't want to specify a license on your Solidity source file, but this should not be left blank.

You can check out the complete list of Solidity Licenses supported by SPDX [here](https://spdx.org/licenses/).

---

## 2. Solidity Pragma

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;
```

In Solidity the pragma keyword is used to configure compiler features and checks.

The first line is a pragma directive which tells that the source code is written for which Solidity version.

---

## 3. Solidity Contract

A contract is a collection of states and functions that is deployed on the blockchain at a specified address.

```solidity
contract GemMine {
    ...
}
```

---

## 4. Solidity Function

In programming, a function is a block of code that performs a task. Theyâ€™re code components that have been encapsulated into a single object.

```solidity
function checkStatus() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Mine is Working With 100% Accuracy";
    }
```

Solidity function breakdown:

- `checkStatus()` is the name of the function.
- `public` is the visiblity of the function which indicates that the function is accessible by other contracts.
- `pure` is the functionâ€™s modifier which indicates that the function does not modify any state.
- `returns` is the functionâ€™s return type which indicates the data types returned by the function.
- `string` keyword specifies the data type of the returned value.
- `memory` keyword means that the variables of the function will be stored in a temporary place while the function is being called.

---

## 5. Mapping and Variables in Solidity

Mapping in Solidity acts like a hash table or dictionary in any other language. These are used to store the data in the form of key-value pairs, a key can be any of the built-in data types but reference types are not allowed while the value can be of any type.

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => Mine) mines;
```

Syntax -

```solidity
mapping(key => value) <access specifier> <name>;
```

```solidity
uint256 public counter = 0;
```

Here we declare a unsigned 256 bit integer variable called `counter` and initialize it to 0.

more on Variables [here](https://dev.to/envoy_/day-4-variables-and-scopes-497b)

---

## 6. Solidity Struct

Solidity allows user to create their own data type in the form of structure. The struct contains a group of elements with a different data type. Generally, it is used to represent a record. To define a structure struct keyword is used, which creates a new data type.

```solidity
struct Mine {
        uint256 id;
        string location;
    }
```

Here we create a struct called `Mine` which contains two fields, `id` and `location`.

`id` - is a unsigned 256 bit integer variable to store ID of the Mine.

`location` - is a string variable to store location of the Mine.

---

## Step 4 - Compiling the Smart Contract

Remix IDE allows us to compile our Solidity smart contracts directly from our browser.

- Ensure to save your source file with CTRL + S.
- If you notice a red flag on the pragma directive like this:

<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5deiojc4h33qgcpc30ma.png">

It means that the Remix IDE compiler is not set to the specified Solidity version in our source code.

To fix this, click on the Solidity compiler icon and select the Solidity version you're using for your smart contract:

<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y8mwzsj7pgkl39uby8kr.png">

Finally, save your source file with `CTRL + S` and click on the compile button. Your Solidity compiler icon should change to green as shown below:

<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eq1a848uub8a6d2khpbs.png">

---

## Step 5 - Deploying the Smart Contract

It's time to deploy our smart contract. Click on the "Deploy & Run Transaction" button from the sidebar.

First, select a JavaScript Virtual Machine Environment (we'll be using the JavaScript London VM for this Solidity tutorial).

You can read more about the Remix IDE Virtual Machine Environment [here](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run.html#run-setup).

<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dkgw65w5ou4skx7gd86t.png">

Next, leave the other default options as they are, and click on the "deploy" button

If the deploy was successful, you'll see our smart contract name under the Deployed Contracts section, which is located under the "deploy" button

<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n2howq6623mp1zx29wv1.png">

The `getter` function is automatically generated for all state variables by the Remix IDE.

---

## Step 6 - Interacting with the Smart Contract

Our first interaction with the smart contract is to call the `checkStatus` function and see if it returns the expected value.

Click on the `checkStatus` button:

<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qnc5zsffnen5y27884e0.png" >

> The Mine is Working With 100% Accuracy

Now Click on the `counter` button which should return its default initial value of 0.

<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rhu4qfwcnb06tsf4vqb8.png" >

In this step we'll check our `addMine` function.

- Fill the `addMine` input box with location of the mine in this case `Sagittarius A*`
- Next click on the `addMine` button to run the function.

<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3c4vn3ilwniexti54wyj.png" >

Now click on the `counter` button which should now return `1` as we have added one mine.

<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iqqe1leno8pn2cn2h1qm.png" >

Now let's test the `getLocation` function.

- Fill the `getLocation` input box with the ID of the mine in this case `1`
- Click on the `getLocation` button to run the function.
- The function should return two outputs, the ID of the mine and the location of the mine.

## It's Done ðŸ¥‚

Congratulations on completing this Solidity tutorial! We've learned how to use the Remix IDE to write, deploy, and interact with our first smart contract.
